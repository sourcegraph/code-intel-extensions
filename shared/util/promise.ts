 * Race an in-flight promise and a promise that will be invoked only after

 * to resolve fairly quickly.
 *
 * This is useful for situations where the primary promise may time-out,
 * and the fallback promise returns a value that is likely to be resolved
 * faster but is not as good of a result. This particular situation should
 * _not_ use Promise.race, as the faster promise will always resolve before
 * the one with better results.
 *
 * @param primary The in-flight happy-path promise.
 * @param makeFallback A factory that creates a fallback promise.
 * @param timeoutMs The timeout in ms before the fallback is invoked.
 * @param filter An optional filter function to determine if a set of results
 * should be returned immediately.
